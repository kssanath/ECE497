	@brief Interface for a gesture classifier functionality 

	This interface should be implemented in order to create a coded gesture.
	The "classify" method is called by the SDK at every frame, getting as input the tracking data,
	and setting as output the label of the detected class.
	The tracking data format is defined by the XML file, which describes this classifier.
	This XML determines the joint that are of interest, the number of frames, scaling options, etc.
