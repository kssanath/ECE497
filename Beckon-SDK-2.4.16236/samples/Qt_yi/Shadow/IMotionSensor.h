	The Omek Beckon SDK provides a robust solution for real-time, 3D motion tracking using 
	a depth camera. The thin and intuitive event-based C++ interface allows developers to quickly create 
	immersive applications, and easily change existing user interfaces with 3D interaction. The middleware 
	is fully compatible with any game engine,  and natively supports the industry-standard FBX animation 
	format for blending pre-generated content with real-time tracking.
